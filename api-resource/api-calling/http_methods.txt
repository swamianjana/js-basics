http methods

1. GET : The GET method is used to retrieve information from the given server using a given URI. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect on the data.

2. POST : A POST request is used to send data to the server, for example, customer information, file upload, etc. using HTML forms.

3. PUT : PUT is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource. Replaces all the current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.

4. PATCH : PATCH is used to update partial resources. For instance, when you only need to update one field of the resource, PUTting a complete resource representation might be cumbersome and utilizes more bandwidth.

5. HEAD : HEAD is almost identical to GET, but without the response body. HEAD transfers the status line and the header section only.

6. DELETE : The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.

7. OPTIONS : The OPTIONS method describes the communication options for the target resource.
